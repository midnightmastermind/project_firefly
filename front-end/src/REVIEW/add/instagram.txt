Store the fetched data in your MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Use React and Redux to display the YouTube channel and video content on the frontend.
Instagram Integration:

Register a new application on the Instagram Developer Platform and get API credentials for the Instagram Basic Display API.
Implement server-side code in Express to handle OAuth authentication and fetch the artist's Instagram content using the obtained access token.
Store the fetched data in your MongoDB database with Mongoose.

To view documents, you can utilize various libraries or tools based on the specific document types you want to support. Here are some examples:

PDF Viewer:

You can use libraries such as react-pdf or react-pdf-js to render PDF files within your React application. These libraries allow you to display PDFs with functionalities like zoom, page navigation, and document downloading.

Word Document Viewer:

For rendering Word documents, you might consider using services like Microsoft Office Online, Google Docs Viewer, or rendering the documents as HTML. These services offer tools for displaying Word documents without needing to install additional software.

Spreadsheet Viewer:

Similar to Word documents, you can use online services like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel Online to display spreadsheet files within your application. Additionally, some libraries support rendering Excel files, such as react-data-sheet for simple tables.

Text Document Viewer:

For plain text or Markdown files, you can create a component that displays the content in a formatted way, using appropriate HTML elements or a Markdown renderer like react-markdown.

Ensure that you handle document loading and rendering efficiently, especially for large files, and consider implementing features like pagination and zooming for better user experience. Additionally, make sure to secure your application when dealing with document rendering, especially if the content is user-generated.
